Req clarification 
1) basements? negative floor?
2) what if on same floor someone wants to go up and someone wants to go down?
3) multiple elevators? can multiple elevators reach the same floor if hey are available (this would be user friendly cuz people prefer less crowded lifts)?
4) helper in lift?
5) elevators an be added/removed? floors can be added?
6) left and right elevator? or only up and down?

elevator state - idle, working, faulty/not working

algo used hashmaps...are there solutions with different data structures?
hasmaps is not a good choice cuz if we introduce some objects in the classes we might end up wit nested maps

separate class for scheduler/dispatcher


we can have either or both
1. any person presses on which floor he wants to go then lifts arrives, or
2. any person just presses the up or down button, lift arrives, and from inside the lift he presses to which floor he wants to go
the request for lifts be it through 1 or 2 will differ and both have to be handled

push request to event bus? what do other youtubers say?
